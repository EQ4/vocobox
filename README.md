#VOCOBOX

Voice controller for digital instruments

<script src="doc/scripts/mermaid.full.min.js"></script>

## Description

Vocobox intend to provide singers with a software able to turn their voice to a musical controller. Voice features (pitch, volume, ...) are used to control external software or hardware producing music.

###### Vocobox 1.0 (01/01/2015)

At this step we are evaluating pitch detection algorithms using the <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/human-voice-dataset">Human Voice Dataset</a>, a dataset containing notes sung by a singer. We define score such as note onset latency, pitch detection latency and <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/blob/master/Benchmark.md">compare samples scores with each other</a>.

We also evaluate pitch detection <i>in live</i> by recording the voice with a microphone, and by generating a feedback sound sounds with a synthetizer controlled according to voice analysis.

To build Vocobox, we gathered :
* a full java additive synthetizer made by chaining oscillators, filters, and other hardware emulation of real synthetizer components based on <a href="http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/">JSyn</a>.
* a pitch detection module based on <a href="https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP">TarsosDSP</a> java library.
* efficient OpenGL charts for monitoring and debugging the sound data workflow based on <a href="http://www.jzy3d.org/">Jzy3d</a> charts.




## Applications

Folder vocobox/dev/java/vocobox-apps provides several applications

#### Controlling Synthetizers with CSV files

Our first attempt to analyze voice signal was <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/blob/master/dev/r">written in R</a> using <a href="http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/">Seewave</a> and <a href="http://aubio.org/">Aubio</a> via an <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/aubio-r/">R binding</a> written for the experiment.

To control JSyn (java) synthetizer, we export frequency and amplitude change commands in two CSV files. Each file contains two columns, the first being elapsed time since song start, the second indicating a value change (frequency changes for pitch.csv, and amplitude changes for envelope.csv). Note that frequency and amplitude can change independently.

Having the original wav file available allows to play in background while executing command events.

#### Controlling Synthetizers with WAV files

To run synthetizer control based on a wav file, see <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/blob/master/dev/java/vocobox-apps/src/main/java/org/vocobox/apps/wav2synth/VocoboxControllerFilePlay.java">VocoboxControllerFilePlay</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/blob/master/dev/java/vocobox-apps/src/main/java/org/vocobox/apps/wav2synth/VocoboxControllerFileRead.java">VocoboxControllerFileRead</a>


#### Controlling Synthetizers with Microphone

To run synthetizer control based on live voice, see <a href="https://github.com/vocobox/vocobox/blob/master/dev/java/vocobox-apps/src/main/java/org/vocobox/apps/mic2synth/VocoboxControllerMic.java">VocoboxControllerMic</a>
